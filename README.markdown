# ZenPush

This gem allows editing your Zendesk knowledge base in Markdown (or HTML). It's a command-line tool.

## Getting Started

    $ gem install zenpush

Run it:

    $ zenpush <command> <args>
    $ zp <command> <args>

## Requirements:

Only installs pure JSON gem json_pure by default. If you are able to install the C-extension json gem, it will use that instead.

Try:

    $ gem install json zenpush

## Configuration

Create a `.zenpush.yml` file in your home directory. Here is an example:

    ---
    :uri: https://myproduct.zendesk.com
    :user: email@address.com/token
    :password: LoDsQlEtBXSd8clW87DgWi0VNFod3U9xQggzwJEH

You can find your API token at https://myproduct.zendesk.com/settings/api.

Additional configuration (optional):

    :filenames_use_dashes_instead_of_spaces: false

## Usage

### Listing categories

    $ zp categories

### Listing forums

    $ zp forums

### Listing topics in a forum

    $ zp topics -f <forum_id>

### Creating/updating a topic

Keep an organized folder of your categories, forums, and topics. Let's say I have the category "Documentation", containing a forum "REST API", and the topics "Introduction" and "Authentication"; you'll want to keep this file structure:

    Documentation/REST API/Introduction.md
    Documentation/REST API/Authentication.md

Creating or updating a topic:

    $ zp push -f <path_to_markdown_file>
    $ zp push -f <path_to_html_file>

Following the previous example, you would type:

    [~/KB/Documentation/REST API]$ zp push -f Authentication.md
    [~/KB/Documentation]$ zp push -f REST API/Authentication.md
    [~/KB]$ zp push -f REST Documentation/API/Authentication.md

The gem will automatically discover the category and forum name of a given topic file. It will also convert your Markdown syntax in HTML before sending it to Zendesk.

### Check if a topic exists

    $ zp exists? -f <path_to_markdown_file>

### Images

ZenPush automatically uploads images linked in your markup, provided they can be located on the file system using
the image path specified.

Image paths are relative to the root of your project. So if you have `![Smiley]('/images/smiley.jpg')`, then ZenPush expects
your JPEG to be at `<project>/images/smiley.jpg`. If ZenPush cannot locate an image on the file system, you will be warned.

Every time you push a document, images that were previously uploaded are automatically discarded and all images
are re-uploaded.

### Markdown Flavors

ZenPush supports two different flavors of markdown: 'standard' and 'github'. The latter flavor supports Github specific
syntax such as fenced code blocks and language specific highlighting.

Language highlighting alters the HTML inside code blocks to support styling. You will still need to specify the
appropriate CSS in your Zendesk account. Highlighting uses Pygments and any of the Pygments styles can be applied.

    $ zp push -f <path_to_markdown_file> -F github
